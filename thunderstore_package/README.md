# Epona Control Overhaul

This mod is for anyone who hates how Epona controls in Majora's Mask, allowing players to tweak her turn and breaking speeds.

Additionally, this mod offers an optional alternate control scheme: Simply point the analog stick in a direction, and that's the direction she'll go.

Features planned for the future:

* An icon not made by ChatGPT.
* Improvements to Epona's jumping recognition.
* Preventing Epona's from stopping for every little random ledge or bump.
